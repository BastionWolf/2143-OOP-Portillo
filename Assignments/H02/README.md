## Definitions

#### Abstraction

> OOP concept that means that the exact knowledge of how a class works is unimportant and should be made to be so. Enstead the methods and varibles that a programmer can call from a class or simular objects is what is important to a progammer needs to know.

#### Attributes / Properties

> Methods and varibles that are elements of a class

#### Class

> A data structure that can be created by a programmer that can function like a series of instructions to make an object; basically you can make your own varible that can have multiple pieces of data or simply be an entire process that your main program can use.

#### Class Varible

> A attribute where only a single copy exists; typically, in the scope of our class so far, this would be a 'global varible' of a class.

#### Composition

> Simular to inheritance except a class only has a part or parts from other classes.

#### Encapsulation

>The hiding of data to stop accidental or unwanted manipulation of data. Ex: Private members of classes.

#### Friends

> A class that allows you to access private and other protected members of another class; Allows you to have a class to access another class's protected members.

#### Inheritance

> A concept in which a class or object uses another class or object in its entireity.

#### Instance Varible

> Varible defined in a class.

#### Member Varible

> A varible that is apart of the class, defined under private, public, or protected.

#### Method

> A function that is within a class

#### Multiple Inheritance

> When a class, or object, is inheritated by more than one classor object.

#### Object

> A declared piece of memory like a varible or an instance of a class.

#### Overloading

> When a there are more than one definition to a function. Most obvious example are the default and non-default constructors of a class.

#### Polymorphism

> A function that behaves differently depending on the situation.

#### Public/ Private/ Protected

> These are the class access modifiers. They will decide how members inside a class can be accessed. 
> Public: can by accessed outside the class
> Private: Can only be accessed inside the class or by a friend function
> Protected: Like Private except what ever inherits the class can also acess it.

#### Virtual

> An object that is inherited and is able to be overriden.
